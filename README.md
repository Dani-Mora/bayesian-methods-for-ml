# Bayesian methods for Machine Learning notes

This repository contains the notes that helped me on the Bayesian
methods for Machine Learning course on Coursera.

Note that solutions quizzes are contained in this repository.

## Setting environment up

To be able to execute the code in some of the notebooks, you must properly set
the development environment.

Make sure conda >=4.8.3 is installed in your system. Then, type:

```shell script
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bayes
```

Then, you can open and execute any of the libraries using Jupyter Lab.
